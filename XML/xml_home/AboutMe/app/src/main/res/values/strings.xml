        "Hey there! Iâ€™m Selva â€” a curious mind with a love for technology,
        creativity, and all things innovative. Whether I'm building something cool,
        exploring new ideas, or just vibing with music and good conversations,
        Iâ€™m always looking for ways to grow and make a positive impact. Friendly,
        focused, and just a little bit obsessed with details. Letâ€™s create something awesome together!
        \n\n1. Professional / Developer Style
ðŸ’» Selva is a passionate Android developer who loves turning ideas into clean, functional apps. With a knack for Jetpack Compose, intuitive UI, and scalable architecture, Selva constantly strives to build tech that makes life easier. Always learning, always building.

2. Creative / Casual
ðŸŽ¨ I'm Selva â€” part thinker, part doer, full-time dreamer. I live for moments of inspiration, deep conversations, and building things that feel alive. Whether itâ€™s an app, a sketch, or a story, I love creating with purpose and style.

3. Minimal &amp; Clean
Hi, Iâ€™m Selva. I make things â€” mostly digital, sometimes analog. Passionate about tech, driven by curiosity, grounded in purpose.

4. Fun &amp; Quirky
Hey! I'm Selva â€” coffee-fueled coder by day, meme curator by night. I break things so I can learn how to fix them. Powered by bugs, features, and the occasional YouTube tutorial spiral.

5. Confident &amp; Ambitious
Iâ€™m Selva, and I build what I believe in. Driven by innovation, backed by skills, and focused on impact â€” Iâ€™m not just here to code. Iâ€™m here to create value.
